                          Five Best songs ever (Android app)

  What is it?
  -----------

  The Five Best songs ever is a Android project for course Google Android Study Jams. 
  This is an example of creating an application with a variety of Views and using Material Design Resources.
  The application has 6 activities:
  - MainActivity.java is a home activity, where you can choose one from 5 my favourite songs.
  - BeatlesActivity.java, LanaDelReyActivity.java and others are detailed description—ã of these songs.
  There is also implemented the animation transitions between Activities and alert dialog window to make sure you want to exit.
  I used the following libraries:
      'compile 'com.android.support:cardview-v7:21.0.+'
      'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:21.0.+'
